Heapsort algorithms can be used in priority queues, order statistics, Prim's algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm, etc. In short, the heap data structure is used when it is important to repeatedly remove the objects with the highest or the lowest priority.

min heap
- parent node is the smallest element, while its children are bigger than it
- root node will be the smallest element in the heap
- can be implemented by an array


max heap
