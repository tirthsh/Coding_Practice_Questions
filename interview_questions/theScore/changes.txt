1. Make rate values as float, not string 
    - this way you dont need to cast to a float / int every time you need to do an operation
2. Make capacity value as integer, not string
    - same reason as above
3. According to the Google JSON style guide, there is a standward way to report Latitude and Longitude 
    - this was not followed in dataset
    - should be in ±DD.DDDD±DDD.DDDD degrees format
    - the dataset had seperate Longitude and Latitude keys/values pair
4. In the rate values, there were also values like "No Maximum" or "NO MAXIMUM" or "Free" or even no rates 
    - this is hard to parse through as there's no standard 
    - a possible way to help standarsize values is use an ENUM object
